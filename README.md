# 🖥️ Digital Console Assistant (Self-Developed Project)

This was my first real Python project – written entirely in the console with pure motivation, curiosity, and coffee ☕.

---

## What It Does

A text-based assistant that offers a simple menu to:

1. 🧮 Calculator – basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
2. 🛒 Shopping List – add and remove items from a list
3. ⏰ Clock – shows current date and time
4. ❌ Exit – quit the program

Navigation is done via keyboard input (1–4).

##  How It Was Built

- I started by building each component separately during class:
  - First the calculator
  - Then the shopping list
  - Then the clock
- Finally, I created a new Python file and combined everything into one program using a simple main menu.

This project was not built using functions or modules yet – just pure step-by-step logic to understand **how programs grow from parts into something complete**.

## What I Learned

- Basics of Python (input, output, control structures)
- Building simple user interfaces in the console
- Combining different components into one file
- Debugging early logic mistakes
- That "it works!" is a real feeling of success 🎉

##  File Overview

- `Der_Digitale_Assistent_Selbstarbeit.py` – the complete assistant in one file

---

##  Next Steps

This console project later became the foundation for my [GUI version of the assistant](https://github.com/NancyRuland/digital_assistant_gui), where I restructured everything modularly with functions, imports, and a graphical interface using Tkinter.
